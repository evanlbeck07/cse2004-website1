            <h1>The F-15 Eagle</h1>
                <img id="topimage" src="https://media.defense.gov/2021/Sep/29/2002864191/1200/1200/0/180918-F-CI489-9250.JPG" alt="An F-15C flying above the Pacific Ocean">
                <h2 class="subheader">Description</h2>
                    <p>The <b>McDonnell Douglas <a href="https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104501/f-15-eagle/" target="_blank">F-15 Eagle</a></b> is a twin-engine, all-weather tactical fighter designed primarily for <a href="https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104501/f-15-eagle/" target="_blank">air superiority</a>. Developed in the late 1960s after lessons learned from the Vietnam War, where U.S. aircraft like the <b>McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II</b> struggled in dogfights against more agile adversaries, the F-15 was built with one goal: total dominance in the skies. It first flew in 1972 and entered service with the United States Air Force in 1976. The Eagle quickly earned a reputation as one of the most successful fighter jets in history, achieving an air-to-air combat record often cited as <b>104 victories with zero losses</b> in aerial combat. Its performance in conflicts involving operators such as the Israeli Air Force cemented its legacy as a premier air superiority platform.</p>
                <h3 class="subheader">Weaponry</h3>
                    <p>In terms of weaponry, the F-15 was designed to carry a powerful mix of air-to-air missiles and internal armament. It is equipped with a <b>20mm M61A1 Vulcan</b> rotary cannon for close-range dogfighting. For beyond-visual-range engagements, the aircraft has traditionally carried the <b>AIM-7 Sparrow</b> and later the more advanced <b><a href="https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104576/aim-120-amraam/" target="_blank">AIM-120 AMRAAM</a></b>, allowing it to engage enemy aircraft at long distances. For short-range, heat-seeking combat, it commonly carries the <b><a href="https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104557/aim-9-sidewinder/" target="_blank">AIM-9 Sidewinder</a></b>. While the original F-15A/C models focused on air superiority, later variants such as the F-15E Strike Eagle expanded capabilities to include air-to-ground missions, carrying precision-guided munitions, laser-guided bombs, and Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs). This flexibility transformed the Eagle platform from a pure interceptor into a multirole combat aircraft.</p>

                    <p>Other armament include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Conformal Fuel Tanks and 610-gallon exxternal drop tanks</li>
                        <li>AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missiles</li>
                        <li>AN/AAQ-33 Sniper XR precision targeting pod</li>
                        <li>AN/ALQ-131 electronic warfare and jamming pod</li>
                        <li>B61 nuclear bomb</li>
                    </ul>
                <h4 class="subheader">Technology</h4>
                    <p>Technically, the F-15’s dominance stems from its powerful radar, engines, and airframe design. Early variants were equipped with the <b>AN/APG-63 pulse-doppler radar</b>, which allowed look-down/shoot-down capability, meaning it could detect and track targets flying below it against ground clutter. Modernized variants use advanced <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_electronically_scanned_array" target="_blank">Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA)</a></b> radars such as the AN/APG-63(V)3 or AN/APG-82, dramatically improving detection range, tracking precision, and resistance to jamming. Power comes from two <b><a href="https://www.rtx.com/en/prattwhitney/products/military-engines/f100" target="_blank">Pratt & Whitney F100</a></b> afterburning turbofan engines, enabling speeds over Mach 2.5 and a thrust-to-weight ratio greater than 1:1 in certain configurations. Its large wing area and lightweight airframe allow exceptional maneuverability, while the twin-tail design improves stability at high angles of attack. Together, these components give the Eagle superior acceleration, climb rate, and sustained turning performance.</p>

                <h5 class="subheader">Modernization Efforts</h5>
                    <p>Despite being designed over 50 years ago, the F-15 continues to evolve. Modernization efforts include radar upgrades, improved electronic warfare suites, digital fly-by-wire systems in newer variants, and advanced cockpit displays. The newest iteration, the <b><a href="https://www.boeing.com/defense/fighters-and-bombers/f-15ex-eagle" target="_blank">F-15EX Eagle II</a></b>, incorporates cutting-edge avionics, expanded weapons capacity, and open mission systems architecture to allow rapid integration of future technologies. Structural upgrades have extended the aircraft’s service life to 20,000 flight hours in some models. Even in an era dominated by fifth-generation fighters like the <b>Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor</b> and <b>Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II</b>, the <b>F-15</b> remains relevant due to its payload capacity, speed, and continual upgrades, proving that strong design foundations can adapt to modern warfare demands.</p>
